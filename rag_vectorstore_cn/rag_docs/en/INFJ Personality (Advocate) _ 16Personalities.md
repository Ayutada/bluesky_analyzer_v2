Advocates are quiet visionaries, often serving as inspiring and tireless idealists.

The INFJ has a wise, thoughtful expression on his face, and he appears to be speaking to the tree. More trees, flowers, and geometric stones are scattered throughout the scene, adding a mystical and imaginative quality. The overall aesthetic is whimsical and dreamy, reflecting the INFJ’s visionary and idealistic nature.](https://www.16personalities.com/static/images/types/headers/advocate-mobile.svg)

# Introduction

Who is the Advocate personality type?

INFJ (Advocate) is a personality type with the [Introverted](/articles/energy-introverted-vs-extraverted), [Intuitive](/articles/mind-intuitive-vs-observant), [Feeling](/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling), and [Judging](/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting) traits. They tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. Their inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things.

> Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being.
>
> Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe

Idealistic and principled, people with the INFJ personality type (Advocates) aren’t content to coast through life – they want to stand up and make a difference. For these compassionate personalities, success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force for good in the world.

While they have lofty goals and ambitions, INFJs shouldn’t be mistaken for idle dreamers. People with this personality type care about integrity, and they’re rarely satisfied until they’ve done what they know to be right. Conscientious to the core, they move through life with a clear sense of their values, and they aim to never lose sight of what truly matters – not according to other people or society at large but according to their own wisdom and intuition.

INFJ personalities might come across as somewhat reserved, but they are fueled by a profound internal passion. Stimulated by deep, reflective thought and an enormous amount of empathy, they dedicate themselves to the pursuit of purpose.

## Seeking Purpose

Perhaps because their personality type is so uncommon, INFJs tend to carry around a sense – whether conscious or not – of being different from most people. With their rich inner lives and their deep, abiding desire to find their life purpose, they don’t always fit in with those around them. This isn’t to say that INFJ personalities can’t enjoy social acceptance or close relationships – only that they sometimes feel misunderstood or at odds with the world.

Fortunately, this sense of being out of step doesn’t diminish INFJs’ commitment to making the world a better place. These personalities are troubled by injustice, and they typically care more about altruism than personal gain. They often feel called to use their strengths – including creativity, imagination, and sensitivity – to uplift others and spread compassion.

Nothing lights up an INFJ personality like changing someone else’s life for the better.

Many INFJs see helping others as their mission in life, and they’re always looking for ways to step in and speak up for what is right. People with this personality type also aspire to fix society’s deeper problems in the hopes that unfairness and hardship can become things of the past. At times, however, INFJs may focus so intently on their ideals that they don’t take adequate care of themselves – a pattern that can lead to stress and burnout.

## Connecting with Others (and Themselves)

INFJs value deep, authentic relationships with others. Few things bring these personalities as much joy as truly knowing another person – and being known in return. INFJs enjoy meaningful conversations far more than small talk, and they tend to communicate in a way that is warm and sensitive. This emotional honesty and insight can make a powerful impression on the people around them.

A few close relationships, provided that they’re genuine, can fill INFJs’ hearts to the brim.

Thoughtful and often selfless, INFJ personalities pour a great deal of energy and care into their relationships, but this doesn’t mean that they always feel appreciated in return. People with this personality type tend to slow down and really evaluate how what they do might impact others before they take action. Consequently, it can frustrate them when other people don’t recognize their good intentions. INFJs are very sensitive to criticism of any kind and can take things very personally.

## A Personal Mission

Many INFJ personalities feel that their life has a unique purpose – a mission that they were put onto this earth to fulfill. For them, one of the most rewarding aspects of life is seeking out this purpose – and then, once they’ve found it, striving to do it justice.

When INFJs encounter inequity or unfairness, they rarely give up – instead, they consult their intuition and their compassion to find a solution. With their innate ability to balance the heart with the head, these dedicated types are hardwired to right the wrongs of the world, no matter how big or small. These personalities just need to remember that while they’re busy taking care of everyone else, they need to pause sometimes and take care of themselves as well.
